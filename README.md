### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- javaScript

### What I learned

I learnt how to manipulate DOM and how to use media query for different screen display. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<li>
          <a class="menuItem" href="#portfolio" onclick="toggleMenu()">Home</a>
        </li>

```
```css
.showMenu {
  width: 78vh;
  height: 100vh;
  transform: translateY(0);
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 17px;
  height: 100vh;
  border-radius: 0;
  padding-top: 69px;
  align-items: left;
  margin-top: 0%;
  margin-left: 12%;
  margin-right: -20%;
  background-color: var(--Off-white);
}
